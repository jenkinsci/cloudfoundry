<div>
  If your application requires a service to be bound to the app, that service needs to be created beforehand.

  Use this option to create services automatically instead of having to do it manually.
  <br/>
  By default, the plugin will not overwrite existing services, so you can use this with no risk if you just want to make
  sure the app will work straight away.
